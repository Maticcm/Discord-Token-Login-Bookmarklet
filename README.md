## 📌 What is this?

A simple bookmarklet that allows you to log into the web version of Discord using your account token.  
It prompts you for a token and injects it into local storage, then reloads the page to log in.

## 🧠 How it Works

The script:
1. Prompts for a Discord token.
2. Injects the token into `localStorage`.
3. Reloads the page to trigger login.
